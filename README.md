# Random-Quiz-Generator-Assembly-Language

        I am sharing with you a simple Assembly Language Project that I created which generates random arithmetic addition queries  with random options each time. 
        
        The user has to guess the answer and complete the quiz (10 questions in total). At last, user will be shown total number of answers that he got right.
        
        This project can be executed using any 8086 microprocessor emulator/assembler (emu8086 recommended). 
        
        The code is pretty straight forward. Even if you have slight knowledge of the Assembly Language syntax, you can easily understand the work put into it.
        
        I have used concept of macros, conditional/unconditional jumps, loops, registers, interupts, functions, etc.
        
        I hope you like my work, thanks for the watch.
